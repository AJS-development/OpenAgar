## Multi-Servers configuration
Using this folder, you can automatically have OpenAgar create additional servers for you. That way, you dont have to use the servers command every time you restart. Also, this allows you to easily change the configurations of the individual servers.

## Usage:

1. Create a file in this directory, the file should be `[Server name].ini`
2. Then, you can override configs in that file. For example, I can put the line `gameMode = 2` to have the server be in teams
3. Start the server. Your server will automatically be created.
